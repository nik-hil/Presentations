# Anti Goal

  > "Tell me where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there." - CHARLIE MUNGER

When cooking positivity in your life, take out the negative. This is a common philosophy shared by many people. Does it work in real life?

A goal defines what we want to achieve in our career, project, life, etc.
 1. "I want a big house, a good car, and a good life," you can say.
 1. An engineer can say, I want to work on the latest tech, big data, a good team, etc.
 1. A client would ask to design a website to accept numbers.

But does it cover everything?
 1. Will you prefer a big house in a forest, a slum area, or in the city Centre?
 1. Will you prefer the latest technology for a high-pressure job?
 1. Will your client prefer a website that can accept numbers as strings?

Another way of bringing clarity is by defining what we don't want.
Let's flip the above requirements.
 1. I don't want to live in a poor neighbourhood, and I don't want a small house.
 1. I don't want to spend my time only doing work.
 1. I don't want to work with a team where there is no money, no proper documentation, no testable code, no sharing of knowledge, etc.
 1. I don't want my website to accept any other input except only English numbers.

Another term we commonly use is "deal breaker" or "red flag." What are deal breakers and red flags?
 1. You don't want to put yourself in a condition that you know is bad. You actively avoid it.

Thinking in terms of what you don't want always clarifies your requirements.

Q. Then how do you approach first? Do you think goal first and define your requirement, or do you think anti-goal first and define your requirement?

A. Both. Think of goal and anti goal as a railing on a bridge that helps you reach the other end of the bridge.


Another example. How does it work for  does it work for us? You don't want a bad day, do you? Well, how does your bad day look?
 1. Full of long meetings
 1. A packed calendar
 1. Dealing with people we don’t like or trust
 1. Owing people things / not being in control / obligations
 1. Having to be at the office
 1. Travel
 1. Tired

So we set anti-goals over this.

 1. Never schedule an in-person meeting when it can otherwise be accomplished via email or phone (or not at all).
 1. No more than 2 hours of scheduled time per day
 1. No business or obligations with people we don’t like—even just a slight bad vibe, and it’s a hard no.
 1. Never give up voting control of our businesses; no favours from people who could need something from us (ensure the rule of reciprocity doesn’t kick in).
 1. Work from a cafe across from a beautiful park where we can come and go as we please with nobody to bother us.
 1. Video conference or pay for people to come visit us.
 1. Never schedule morning meetings, sleep in when needed.
